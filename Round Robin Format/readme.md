# Tournament Scheduler
---
- Have you ever organized a tournament, or have you ever played a tournament, more importantly in a **Round Robin Format**?
- Well. Fortunately, I have played as well as organised multiple Tournaments.

## Round Robin Tournaments
- Round robin tournaments are a popular format in sports and other competitions where each team or player plays against every other team or player in the tournament exactly once. 
- This format ensures fairness by providing each participant with an equal number of matches and opportunities to compete.
- In a round robin tournament with \( n \) participants, each participant plays \( n - 1 \) matches.

## About the programs
- This program is designed to generate a schedule for a tournament in a round-robin format. 
- It takes a list of teams as input and creates a schedule where each team plays against every other team exactly once.
- Not just that, I've programmed it in such a way that no team gets to play consecutive Matches.
- For example, if **team1** and **team2** has played the Match no.1 then, for Match no.2 the two teams shouldn't be either team1 or team2.
- After considering a numerous number of approaches, I was able to program it for **max 10 number of teams**.
- Also, I found out there should be **atleast 5 teams** for teams to not play consecutive matches.

## Use Cases and Future Scope

### Use Cases:
1. **Sports Tournaments:** This program can be used to schedule round robin tournaments for various sports such as cricket, football, basketball, volleyball, and any other sports. It ensures that each team competes against every other team in a fair and balanced manner.

2. **Esports Competitions:** Esports tournaments often involve round robin formats, especially in games with team-based competitions like Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and League of Legends. This program can help organizers efficiently schedule matches for such tournaments.

3. **Academic Competitions:** Round robin tournaments are also common in academic competitions, debates, and quiz competitions. Organizers can utilize this program to create schedules for events where participants compete against each other multiple times.

4. **Corporate Events:** Companies often organize team-building events or sports competitions for their employees. This program can assist in scheduling matches for such events, ensuring that each team has an equal opportunity to compete against others.

### Future Scope:
1. **Scalability:** Currently, the program supports up to 10 teams due to the complexity of avoiding consecutive matches for the same teams. Future improvements could focus on enhancing the algorithm to support a larger number of teams while maintaining the constraint of non-consecutive matches.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Implementing a user-friendly GUI can make the program more accessible to users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces. A GUI can allow users to input teams, view the generated schedule, and make any necessary adjustments easily.

3. **Customization Options:** Adding options for customization, such as specifying match durations, venue preferences, and scheduling constraints, can make the program more versatile and adaptable to different tournament requirements.

4. **Integration with Calendar Applications:** Integrating the scheduler with popular calendar applications like Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook can help organizers manage tournament schedules more efficiently and synchronize with participants' calendars.

5. **Automated Result Tracking:** Implementing features for automated result tracking and scorekeeping can streamline the management of tournaments, especially for large-scale events with multiple matches happening simultaneously.
